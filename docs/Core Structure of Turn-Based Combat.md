Core Structure of Turn-Based Combat (Condensed)
Turn-based combat in RPGs like D&D and Cyberpunk follows a consistent tactical structure to ensure fairness, flow, and strategy.

🔢 Initiative & Turn Order
At combat start, each participant rolls for initiative (e.g., 1d20 + DEX).

Combatants act in descending order of initiative each round.

🔁 Rounds & Turns
Combat proceeds in rounds. Each participant gets one turn per round.

A turn allows one or more actions, depending on system rules.

🎯 Actions on Turn
Most systems allow some combination of:

Standard Action: Attack, cast, use item, special maneuver

Move Action: Move up to speed; some allow splitting movement

Bonus Action: Fast class-based or item-based actions

Reaction: Triggered outside of turn by specific events (e.g., opportunity attacks, hold actions)

🎲 Action Resolution
Attack Rolls: Roll vs. target defense stat (e.g., AC or DV)

Opposed Rolls: Both attacker/defender roll; higher result wins (used in melee or skill contests)

Damage Rolls: Rolled if attack succeeds; applied to HP

Special Actions: Grapples, disarms, headshots, etc. often involve penalties or bonus effects

🛡️ Positioning, Cover & LoS
Cover: Makes a character harder or impossible to hit; binary in some systems

Line of Sight: Required to target most enemies

Tactical Positioning: Flanking, control zones, and movement constraints add strategic depth

🧠 Advanced Combat Concepts
Delayed Actions: Ready a trigger-based response ("I shoot if he moves")

Critical Injuries: Some hits may trigger critical wound systems

Environmental Interactions: Use of terrain, obstacles, or traps as part of combat

Stances/Modes: Temporary states that change stats/abilities (e.g., “defensive stance”)

Trade-offs: Choose between damage, buffs, debuffs, or positioning for tactical diversity

✅ Summary
Turn-based RPG combat is built on initiative-driven turns, action economy, and tactical decision-making. While systems differ, most share these foundational mechanics—roll for turn order, act in rounds, choose strategic actions, and resolve outcomes based on player and enemy stats.
